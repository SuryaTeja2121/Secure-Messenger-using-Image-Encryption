# Secure-Messenger-using-Image-Encryption

This projects helps the user send any Secret mseeage by hiding it inside any image image (known as Steganography), without a noticable change and not compromising on the image quality.

Furthermore, the user can also ecnrypt the entire image for higher security and then than encrypted file to the end receiver.
The user is prompted with two options - encrypt text inside the image using AES and TDES and also encrypt the entire image using the both algorithms.

The final encrypted file is in a '.enc' format, and consists of meaningless symbols and alphabets, therefore, anyone who is trying to trap or disrupt data while transmission is taking place, will not be able to understnad what type file is the orignal one.

Please view the Research Paper provided in the main directoy to see detailed information on the ecnryption and decryption processes along with images...

Thank You.
